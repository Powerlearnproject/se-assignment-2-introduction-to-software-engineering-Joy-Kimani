Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is an engineering approach to software development. This involves designing,defining, developing, implementing, testing, managing and maintaining software systems.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a discipline that involves the applying engineering principles to the design process of develping reusable and reliable software systems , while traditional programming focuses primarily on writing code to implement specific functions or solve particular problems.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software engineers to design, develop, and test high-quality software which focuses on producing software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, within time and cost estimates.
    Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle:

1.Planning: This is the first phase whereby the project’s scope and objectives are defined. It involves
 project charter creation, feasibility analysis, resource planning and timeline setting.

2.Requirements Analysis: In this phase, the specific requirements of the software are gathered and documented. This includes understanding what the users need and ensuring these needs are clearly articulated.

3.Design: This phase focuses on creating the actual design of the system.

4.Implementation: This is the phase where the actual coding takes place based on the design documents. Developers write code to build the software components.

5.Testing: This phase involves testing to various parts of the software to ensure the software meets required standards of the users, is reliable and usable to various types of users.

6.Deployment: In this phase, the software is released to the users (production environment).

7.Maintenance: This phase ensures the software continues to perform well and adapts to new requirements which includes bug fixing, software updates and user support.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile vs. Waterfall Models
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one starts while agile model is an iterative and intergrated model that focuses on meeting uswer requiremnets, flexibility and rapid delivery of small, functional pieces of the software.


Waterfall Model:
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one starts.
Advantages:
  - The process is well-documented.
  - Simple and easy to understand.
  - The stages are clearly defined.
Disadvantages:
  - It is hard to make changes.
  - Users are not actively involved in the development process.

Agile Model:
-Agile is an iterative and intergrated model that focuses on meeting uswer requiremnets, flexibility and rapid delivery of small, functional pieces of the software. It adapts to changes quickly and encourages frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans.
Advantages:
  - It is easy to make requirement changes at any stage of the process.
  - There is continuous user involvement and feedback which leads to creation of a software that meets users needs.
  - Frequent delivery of functional software that meets users' expectation.
Disadvantages:
  - It requires a high level of collaboration and communication.
  - There is less emphasis on documentation which might make the next developers work to be harder since the thought process has not been laid out by the previous developer.

Scenarios Where Each Model is Preferred:
Waterfall:
They are used when a project is well-defined and with stable(static) requirementswhich can include projects where technology and tools are well understood and not expected to change. It can also be used where the project scope and deliverables are clearly defined from the start.

Agile:
They are used where the project has dynamic or evolving requirements and whereby quick delivery of a working product is required. They can aslo be used where the project involves innovative technology or is in a high risk domain.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Requirements engineeering is the systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system.

The process of Requirements engineering:
1.Feasibility Study
2.Requirements elicitation
3.Requirements specification
4.Requirements for verification and validation
5.Requirements management

1. Feasibility Study: This procedure begins with gathering needs from relevant parties. The goal is to understand the specifications, limits, and expectations related to the software system.It consists of the following items: 
-Technical Feasibility: This analysis establishes if the project can be developed using the appropriate technology and resources.
-Operational Feasibility: This component evaluates how well a product will fulfill requirements and how easy it will be to use and maintain after it is put into use.
-Economic Feasibility: The Economic Feasibility study looks at the project's expenses and advantages.

2.Requirements Elicitation:Requirements elicitation is the process of gathering information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. This is the first step for requirements engineering.

3.Requirements Specification: This procedure is used to generate formal software requirement models. 
Requirements specification is the process of precisely, systematically, and explicitly defining the requirements discovered during the analysis step. involves prioritizing the demands and breaking them down into manageable chunks.

4. Requirements Validation and Verification
Verification is the process of checking, through a series of tasks, that a specific function is implemented correctly by the program. 
Validation refers to a specific group of actions designed to ensure that the software produced can be connected back to the demands of the customer.

5. Requirements Management
Requirement management is the process of determining, recording, monitoring, prioritizing, and managing communication with relevant parties in addition to evaluating, recording, and monitoring needs. The

Importance of RE
-Ensures all stakeholders have a clear and common understanding of what the software should do which helps to avoid confusion and misunderstanding.
-Identifies potential issues and constraints early in the project to mitigate risks.
-it ensures that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its users.
-Helps avoid costly and time-consuming changes during later stages of the project.
-Ensures that the developed software meets specified quality standards.
-Provides a framework for tracking progress and managing scope.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
Modularity refers to the practice of dividing a complex software system into smaller, independent modules.
Modularity enables easier management and update individual modules by making it easier to debug individual modules and making changes that is only limited to a specific module.
Modularity enables one to add or modify modules without disrupting the entire system.


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

1.Unit Testing: Unit testing focuses on individual components of the software. Each unit is tested in isolation from the rest of the system.

2.Integration Testing: Integration testing examines the interactions between different components of the software to ensure they work together correctly.

3.System Testing: System testing evaluates the complete and integrated software system as a whole.

4.Acceptance Testing: Acceptance testing is the final level of testing before the software is released to the end-users. It validates that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.

Importance of Testing in Software Development
   - Ensures that the software meets the required quality standards and specifications.
   - Helps deliver a reliable and robust product to the users.
   - Identifies defects early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort needed to fix them.
   - Helps build user confidence and trust in the software product.
   - Identifies and mitigates security vulnerabilities, protecting user data and privacy.
   - Ensures that the software is stable and performs well under various conditions.
   - Ensures that new features or changes do not introduce unexpected issues.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
